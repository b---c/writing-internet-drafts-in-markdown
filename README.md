This repo contains information about creating Internet Drafts in Markdown. 

Internet Drafts are the starting point for the standards process within the 
[Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://www.ietf.org/). Also referred to 
as "drafts" or "IDs", anyone can create an Internet Draft and submit it through
the [IETF datatracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/).

Internet Drafts can be created using a variety of tools and templates. The primary 
mechanism for the past while has been to use XML and the [xml2rfc tool](https://pypi.org/project/xml2rfc/))
( also [available online](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/).

In recent years, new tools have emerged allowing the creation of Internet Drafts using
variations of Markdown syntax.

This repo includes:

- Slides from a presentation I gave on June 12, 2018, at the "IETF Hub Boston" meeting 
  in Cambridge, MA. (The slides themselves are in Markdown).
- Slides from a tutorial on March 24, 2019, at IETF 104 in Prague.
- Examples of markdown files for both the kramdown and mmark tools.
