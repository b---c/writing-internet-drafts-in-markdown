This is a repo for a presentation I will give on June 12, 2018, at the "IETF Hub Boston" meeting in Cambridge, MA.
The topic is "**Writing Internet Drafts using Markdown**".

The slides in `writing-internet-drafts-in-markdown.md` were developed to be processed by Marp - https://yhatt.github.io/marp/
