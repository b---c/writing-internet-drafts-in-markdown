This is a repo for a presentation I gave on June 12, 2018, at the "IETF Hub Boston" meeting in Cambridge, MA.
The topic was "**Writing Internet Drafts using Markdown**".

The slides in `writing-internet-drafts-in-markdown.md` were developed to be processed by Marp - https://github.com/marp-team/marp/#readme
