1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

   More infomation can be found in [I-D.nottingham-for-the-users].  (An
   exmple of an informative reference to a draft in the middle of text.
   Note that referencing an Internet draft involves replacing "draft-"
   in the name with "I-D.")

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   This is some background text.

4.  Use Cases

   This section will include some use cases for our new protocol.  The
   use cases conform to the guidelines found in [RFC7258].
   (Demonstrating a normative reference inline.)

   Note that the section heading also includes an anchor name that can
   be referenced in a cross reference later in the document, as is done
   in Section 5 of this document.  (Demonstrating using a reference to a
   heading without writing an actual anchor, but rather using the
   heading name in lowercase and with dashes.)

4.1.  First use case

   Some text about the first use case. (and an example of using a second
   level heading.)

   HTTP version 2 is defined in [HTTP2].  (Demonstrating renaming a
   reference so that it is "HTTP2" instead of "RFC7540".  You need to do
   this the first time you use a reference.  From here on in the
   document you can just use "HTTP2" in a reference.)

4.2.  Second use case

   This example includes a list:

   o  first item

   o  second item

   o  third item, with a reference to [HTTP2].

   And text below the list.

5.  Security Considerations

   As outlined earlier in Section 4, there could be security issues in
   various use cases.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
